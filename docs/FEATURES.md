## 1. Authentication & RBAC

**Status: ✅ Done**

### Roles

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| `rm` | Relationship Manager — sees only their own book of accounts |
| `manager` | Team manager — sees their accounts + all direct reports' accounts |
| `executive` | VP/C-suite — sees all accounts org-wide (read-only on queue) |
| `admin` | Full access to all features including admin panel |

### Auth Flow

- **Phase 1A (Dev):** Dev persona switcher in header (hidden in production). Default: `pulse-admin`.
- **Phase 1B (Live):** Google Workspace OAuth — `/api/auth/google/start` → Google consent → FastAPI `/auth/google/callback` → tokens saved to `pulse.google_sessions` → redirects to `/login?google=success&google_user_id=<id>`. Only emails in `ALLOWED_EMAILS` whitelist can authenticate.
- Session persisted in `localStorage` (`pulse_user_id`). Logout clears storage and sets a `sessionStorage` flag to block DEV auto-login.

### User Hierarchy (Real Salesforce Users)

```

```

All users have real Salesforce `sfUserId` (18-char) used to filter `owner_id` in the DB.

### Route Guards

- **RoleGuard** — wraps every route; redirects unauthorized roles.
- **AccountScopeGuard** — enforces RM/Manager scope on `/accounts/:id`; Execs/Admin bypass.

### Role → Default Route

| Role | Landing |
|---|---|
| `rm` | `/accounts` |
| `manager` | `/accounts` |
| `executive` | `/executive` |
| `admin` | `/actions` |

---

## 13. Signal Source Adapters

**Status: ✅ SFDC done · ⚠️ Chorus/Calendar/Opp-Tracker modules built, not wired to live ingestion**

**Module:** `core/adapters/`

| Adapter | File | Lines | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Salesforce | `sfdc.py` | 322 | ✅ Live — wired to sync + support chat |
| Chorus | `chorus.py` | 232 | ⚠️ Module complete; ingestion pipeline not triggered |
| Calendar | `calendar.py` | 193 | ⚠️ Module complete; not wired |
| Opportunity-Tracker | `opportunity_tracker.py` | 149 | ⚠️ Module complete; not wired |

Base adapter interface in `base.py` + episode normalization in `episode.py`.

To complete Phase 1: wire Chorus, Calendar, and Opp-Tracker adapters into the ingestion pipeline and trigger from the event loop.

---

## 14. Memory Layer

**Status: ⚠️ Partial — modules exist; not actively ingesting**

**Modules:** `core/memory/`

| Component | File | Status |
|---|---|---|
| PulseKuzuDriver (FTS bootstrap subclass) | `driver.py` | ⚠️ Exists (76 lines); not connected to live episode ingestion |
| Three-graph schema | `graph.py` | ⚠️ Schema defined |
| Retrievers | `retrievers.py` | ⚠️ Query interface defined |
| Denylist | `denylist.py` | ✅ Test-account exclusion implemented |

Graphiti (temporal memory engine) and Kuzu (graph backend) are the locked choices per ADRs. Phase 1 requires connecting the signal source adapters → Episode normalizer → Graphiti ingestion.

---

## 15. Signal Definition Library

**Status: ⚠️ All 14 definitions implemented; runtime exists; not triggered live**

**Modules:** `core/signals/` + `02_planning/signals/` (specs)

| Signal | Implementation |
|---|---|
| `account_silence_pattern_v1` | ✅ |
| `churn_signal_competitor_mention_v1` | ✅ |
| `churn_signal_contact_disengagement_v1` | ✅ |
| `churn_signal_renewal_period_silence_v1` | ✅ |
| `churn_signal_sentiment_decline_v1` | ✅ |
| `client_termination_pattern_v1` | ✅ |
| `escalation_signal_case_pattern_v1` | ✅ |
| `escalation_signal_severity_jump_v1` | ✅ |
| `expansion_signal_job_posting_match_v1` | ✅ |
| `expansion_signal_verbal_capacity_mention_v1` | ✅ |
| `recognition_signal_advocacy_candidate_v1` | ✅ |
| `talent_burnout_signal_v1` | ✅ |
| `talent_growth_concern_v1` | ✅ |
| `talent_pay_concern_v1` | ✅ |

`runtime.py` exists to execute signal detection. Each definition has a corresponding `.md` spec in `02_planning/signals/`. No black-box detection — every mechanism is inspectable.

---

## 16. Skills Layer

**Status: 🔲 Planned — `run_skill()` stub only; specs 018-028 not implemented**

**Module:** `core/agent/runner.py`

The async-everything agent runner (ADR-001) exposes `run_skill(skill_id, ...)`. Currently a `NotImplementedError` stub per §6 rule 14 (no silent no-ops). Skills 01–11 (specs 018-028) are the outstanding backend work for Phase 1.

Skills to build:
- Skill 01: Account silence detection
- Skill 02: Churn signal triangulation
- Skill 03: Renewal window outreach
- Skill 04: Sentiment decline response
- Skill 05: Competitor mention response
- Skill 06: Escalation case response
- Skill 07: Talent burnout intervention
- Skill 08: Expansion intent detection
- Skill 09: Recognition + advocacy capture
- Skill 10: Client termination pattern
- Skill 11: Expansion intent from job posting

---

## 17. Event Log & Reasoning Capture

**Status: ⚠️ Partial — schema + log module exist; wired to DB**

**Module:** `core/events/`

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| Event schema + types | ✅ Defined |
| `log.py` (538 lines) | ✅ Logging functions implemented |
| DB write path | ⚠️ Wired; not exercised without live skill runs |
| Query interface | ✅ `queries.py` exists |

Every agent action must log to the event log with reasoning attached (§6 rule 14). This becomes fully exercised once skills are wired.

---

## 18. Backend API Reference

| PUT | `/profiles/{type}/{entity_id}` | RM override of profile content |

---

## Key Design Principles

- **No auto-send** — every AI-proposed action requires explicit RM approval
- **No black-box detection** — every signal has a Signal Definition Library entry with a corresponding `.md` spec
- **Human-in-the-loop is the product** — Action queue is the hero surface
- **Scope enforcement** — RBAC enforced server-side (actions API) and client-side (route guards + filter params)
- **Real-data first** — accounts from live Salesforce via 12-hour DB sync
- **Tier-aware behavior** — SMB → more automation; Enterprise → more human-in-the-loop
- **Motion & accessibility** — `FadeLift` + Framer Motion `AnimatePresence`; `prefers-reduced-motion` respected
- **White-label** — no Anthropic/AI branding exposed to end users

---

## What's Left for Demo Day (June 30)

### Must-complete (Phase 1 scope)

1. **Wire signal source adapters** — Chorus, Calendar, and Opp-Tracker into live ingestion pipeline
2. **Skills 01–11** — implement `run_skill()` for all 11 skills (specs 018-028)
3. **Per-account drill-down view** — replace Placeholder at `/accounts/:id` (specs 036-037)
4. **Connect memory layer** — Graphiti + Kuzu receiving live episodes from adapters
5. **Layer 8 synthetic seed** — populate outcome records (spec 045a)
6. **Demo storyboard** — DHR Health Clinics + Mendota Insurance + Cirventis/Helix (specs 046-047)
7. **Activepieces on Fly.io** — deploy workflow engine (ADR-002)
8. **Langfuse on Fly.io** — deploy observability backend (ADR-003)

### Won't-do (v1.5+)

- Slack slash command for outreach submit
- Zoom Signal Source Adapter
- Slack Signal Source Adapter
- Product Adoption Monitor skill (Skill 07 deferred per §13)
- Dynamic Enterprise EBR-tie-in copy
- Demo HTML fallback (lower priority given live-data approach)
